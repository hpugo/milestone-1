## What's Balloon Pop?
A simple fun browser game where you try to pop 9 balloons as quickly as you can! Compete with yourself in attempting to improve your time every time you play it. 
## How to Play?
Playing the game is quite easy, everyone can give it a go! Once you load up the browser just hit start whenever you're ready to begin playing, wait for the timer to hit zero and start going at it. Speed is key to this game so try you're best to be quick!

## Bumps Along The Road
One of my first issues became a nightmare, while in hindsight it was such a simple spelling mistake, I had thought that my JS code was not working but it ended up not correctly linked to my html document. Refreshing and using my google dev tools made me really overthink such a small issue but once I got that done it was much a relief as it was a first step forward to my project.
As I continued my project I wasn't sure how to add a proper timer, I started off with a timer that was going from 1 second intervals, but I wasn't satisfied with the result because I wanted to maker sure it was much more specific and exact, and I remember from one of the lessons going over and telling us how time works in our JS it was a simple fix as to lowering the timer to 50 allowing me to make the time be recorded much more specifically.
The design was something I wasn't so sure about but I got inspiration from the video and since the theme of the games was going to be popping ballons I wanted to make it colorful and much more bright so I choose the bright color of my background.
## Resources I Used to Create My Project
My initial idea was to make a balloon popping game but not being sure on how start I looked up some videos on youtube and two videos helped me a ton. 

First video: https://youtu.be/ej8SatOj3V4?si=_B7k9Op7YAmhO2bM 
This video helped me develop a ground work and layout my foundation on how I wanted my game to look and feel. 

Second video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7W2QJBE600&list=PLeoZ_htor14UV1HQJ5oEoflBdpiY03yq9&index=1&t=251s 
In this video, it helped me decided how I wanted my balloons to be. I was debating on making balloons from code or go a little bit more simpler, balloons from images I was able to get. I choose to opt for the images but the video helped me understand what to make sure to look out for with my css and js.
## Some Things I Want to Improve
While being a simple project, I felt very challenged in trying to make this game. I definitely have a ton more ideas I want to add to my game as soon as I learn more skills and tricks! Like adding a leaderboard, making a levels element where there are waves of balloons and it'll be a little bit more of a variety in gameplay but I'm excited what the future hold for me and this project.
