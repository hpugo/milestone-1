##Bumps Along The Road
One of my first issues became a nightmare, while in hindsight it was such a simple spelling mistake, I had thought that my JS code was not working but it ended up not correctly linked to my html document. Refreshing and using my google dev tools made me really overthink such a small issue but once I got that done it was much a relief as it was a first step forward to my project.
As I continued my project I ran into the issue of changing my image to signify a balloon had been popped, 

## Resources I Used to Create My Project
My initial idea was to make a balloon popping game but not being sure on how start I looked up some videos on youtube and two videos helped me a ton. 

First video: https://youtu.be/ej8SatOj3V4?si=_B7k9Op7YAmhO2bM 
This video helped me develop a ground work and layout my foundation on how I wanted my game to look and feel. 

Second video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7W2QJBE600&list=PLeoZ_htor14UV1HQJ5oEoflBdpiY03yq9&index=1&t=251s 
In this video, it helped me decided how I wanted my balloons to be. I was debating on making balloons from code or go a little bit more simpler, balloons from images I was able to get. I choose to opt for the images but the video helped me understand what to make sure to look out for with my css and js.
